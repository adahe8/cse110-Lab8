**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**  
Service workers take an existing application and make it more robust, secure, and usable for audiences. Because they work with the cache of the browser, storing data there, they allow an interactive application to work offline, thus expanding the possible situations that the app runs across, and making it less vulnerable to crashing. Service workers utilize the cache to keep core fucntionality running without interner, thereby upholding the graceful degradation principles of maintaining funcitonality and performance even if services or needed components fail.
